# MaterialApp-Android-Jetpack 🎉📱

Welcome to the repository for the MaterialApp Android application built using Jetpack Compose! This app is a simple Material Design application that demonstrates the use of various Material Design components in Jetpack Compose. It's a fun and interactive way to explore the capabilities of Jetpack Compose. 😄🚀

## Features 🎯

- Uses `MaterialTheme` to apply a theme to its children.
- Uses `Scaffold` to provide a layout structure for your app. The `Scaffold` includes a `TopAppBar`, `FloatingActionButton`, and `BottomAppBar`.
- The `TopAppBar` includes a title with the text "My App".
- The `FloatingActionButton` includes an `Icon` with an add icon.
- The `BottomAppBar` includes a `Row` of `CustomIconButton`s. The `Row` fills the maximum width and arranges its children evenly.
